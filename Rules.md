## Objective

## Gameplay

### Step 1: Rolling the Dice

Each player takes turns rolling all six dice. After every roll, the player must keep at least one scoring die.

### Step 2: Scoring

Points are earned based on the numbers rolled:

- **Single die**:
  - 1: 100 points
  - 5: 50 points
- **Three of a Kind**:
  - 1's: 1,000 points
  - 2's: 200 points
  - 3's: 300 points
  - 4's: 400 points
  - 5's: 500 points
  - 6's: 600 points
- **Additional die of a three of a kind**: Adds the three of a kind value
- **Straight (1-2-3-4-5-6)**: 1000 points
- **Three Pairs**: 1000 points

### Step 3: Continuing Play

After setting aside at least one scoring die, the player may choose to continue rolling the remaining dice to accumulate more points or end their turn and keep the points.

**Farkle**: If a player rolls the dice and no scoring combinations are achieved, the player has "Farkled" and will lose all points accumulated during that turn. Their turn ends and play moves to the next player.

### Step 4: Reaching 10,000 Points

Once a player reaches 10,000 points, all other players have one last opportunity to take a turn and try to beat the leading player's score.

## Winning

The player with the highest score equal to or above 10,000 points at the end of the final round is declared the winner.
