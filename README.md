# DiceGame

This repository contains the code for an online, multiplayer version of 10,000 - a popular dice game also known as Farkle, Greed, Zilch, or Zonk. It played with six dice and requires two or more players. The objective of the game is to be the first to reach a score of 10,000 points. The game combines luck and strategy, as players make decisions about taking risks to accumulate points and progress toward the winning goal.

# Idea
To play, users will have to create a username. Then they can either play with random people or play with players they add as friends identified by their usernames. The gameplay screen will feature the six dice, an icon and tag at the top for each player, a scoreboard, and a chat. Players will take turns rolling the dice until someone wins. At that point, players will be able to play again with the same crowd or leave the game, or enter a random game.
